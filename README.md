**Socklet** is a lightweight and high-performance C framework designed for building scalable and event-driven socket-based applications. Inspired by modern frameworks, **Socklet** simplifies the complexities of socket programming, enabling developers to create real-time communication systems with minimal effort.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Event-Driven Architecture** – Efficiently handle multiple client connections using non-blocking I/O.  
- **Lightweight and Fast** – Optimized for performance with minimal dependencies.  
- **Room-Based Messaging** – Supports broadcasting messages to specific groups of clients.  
- **Custom Middleware Support** – Extend functionality with custom middleware for data validation, logging, and more.  
- **Flexible Protocol Handling** – Seamlessly integrate custom protocols or work with existing ones like WebSocket or TCP.  
- **Scalable Design** – Suitable for microservices, chat systems, gaming servers, and IoT solutions.  
- **Open-Source and Extensible** – Built for developers to modify and extend as needed.  

### **Use Cases:**  
- Real-time chat applications.  
- Multiplayer online games.  
- IoT device communication.  
- Notification systems.  
- Collaborative tools like whiteboards or document editors.  

**Socklet** is built with simplicity in mind, providing a developer-friendly API to focus more on application logic and less on low-level socket handling.
